If you want to hack on PythonForumIDE you need the following software:
  - Python 2.7.1
  - wxPython 2.8
  - Twisted 10.2.0-1

PythonForumIDE uses the PEP-8 Coding Style, which can be found here:
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

When in doubt copy the coding style of the file you are editing.

All id's must come from gui_lib/ide_constants.py.
Do not push to master unless explicitly requested.
If you want to implement a new feature, create an issue ticket
and a new branch, preferably with the issue number e.g. issue_42
Create a separate branch for any issues or new features.
See this guide for help: http://progit.org/book/ch3-0.html

git clone git@github.com:Python-Forum/PythonForumIDE.git

To run it, try the following from the pythonforumide/ directory:
